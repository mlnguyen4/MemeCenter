# MemeCenter

Note: This application was made by Matthew Nugyen and Sylvan Mostert. It was part of a school project in DPS924, and was intended to learn the concepts of Android programming.

## Introduction

The Meme Center is a chat filter for a Twitch stream on the Android platform. The end goal of this application is to filter out all chat messages that is not a meme (Internet pop culture) or copy pastas (copied spam).

The end user of a Twitch chat application is looking for an unintrusive experience to view and participate in a full featured chat. Being unable to filter unwanted messages in a userâ€™s chat creates an irritating and disappointing experience.

While filtering out the chat for only memes and copypastas seems only useful for a small subset of users, there is a possibility of implementing the opposite, where the app filters out memes, copypastas and spam in general which could be useful for the average end user and the streamers themselves.
